This project is a real-time, interactive music-sharing platform designed for parties or group gatherings. It allows multiple users to join the same virtual "party room" and collaboratively decide on the music playlist. Key features include:

Spotify Integration: Participants can connect their Spotify accounts to queue songs, vote on which songs to play next, and skip tracks. The collective votes influence the music flow, creating a fun, democratic experience for everyone.

Lyric Search: Even if users can't recall the exact song name, they can input lyrics into the search bar. The system will return the top 10 songs with the closest matching lyrics, enhancing discovery.

Mood-Based Playlists: Using GPT, users can select their current mood (e.g., happy, chill, energetic), and the system will recommend the top 10 songs that match that mood, ensuring a personalized experience for everyone in the room.

Musixmatch API Integration: For each song, detailed information such as lyrics, artist background, and album details are showcased via Musixmatch, enriching the listening experience with contextual knowledge.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
